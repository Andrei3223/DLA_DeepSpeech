## About

This repository contains a template for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based Deep Learning projects.

The template utilizes different python-dev techniques to improve code readability. Configuration methods enhance reproducibility and experiments control.

Repository is realised as a part of [HSE DLA course](https://github.com/markovka17/dla), however, can easily be adopted for any DL-task.

## Examples

> [! IMPORTANT]
> Main branch leaves most of the code parts empty, showing just the base structure. The final users can add code required for their own tasks.

You can find examples of this template completed for different tasks in other branches:

* [Image classification](todo): simple classification problem on [MNIST](todo) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf) datasets.

* [ASR](todo): template for the automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. Some of the parts (for example, ``collate_fn``) are missing for studying purposes of [HSE DLA course](https://github.com/markovka17/dla).
